This plugin adds a link in admin bar to clear the cache generated by Hyper Cache. No settings, just a button.

== Description ==

This plugin just adds a link in admin bar to clear the cache generated by [Hyper Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyper-cache/) plugin.
The link also shows the number of cached pages.
It has no Settings page, no UI, it just displays a new entry in admin bar.

Only users that have 'manage_option' capability will see the link (same as Hyper Cache Plugin requirement).

This plugin is useful to test theme modifications, or if you need sometimes to reset the cache from everywhere in your blog.

Uses the Hyper Cache translations.
